MBS.Auth0
=========

This module provides an easy-to-use widget to allowing logging in to your Orchard website using [Auth0](http://www.auth0.com/).

It is heavily inspired by [RM.QuickLogOn](https://rmquicklogon.codeplex.com/)

Usage:
 
 - Install like any other module
 - Enable
 - Go to *Settings / Auth0* and enter the information for your app
 - Add the widget (which is just a button) to the desired layers
